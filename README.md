# Improving Application Tests

In this task, we will look at a task regarding application/integration tests.
Companies do not like spending money on code/effort that does not directly translate to revenue. This often means developers are to spend minimal to no time on application tests. Furthermore, it is often "good enough" if the application only has unit tests. Unfortunately, this can lead to future problems and heavily impact an application deployment.

WhizCorp has reached this point for one of its critical services and has to invest time into fixing this issue now!

## Guidance

1. Read [the story](STORY.md)
2. Read the [notes](NOTES.md)
3. Think it trough, make some notes, and prepare for a discussion.
4. If anything is badly defined, ask WhizCorp for clarification or make assumptions on your own (and write them down!)
5. Discuss your strategy with your teammates Alice and Bob.
