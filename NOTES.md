# Notes

* Try to analyze the problems from one direction, then from the other.
* Keep open/unclear topics for the discussion with your colleagues. Teamwork is always important on difficult tasks.
* Think of how to present your ideas. Do you require some simple diagrams, or are you able to explain everything with words only?
* Focus on the parts for which you have a clear goal in mind. Discuss unclear/open parts with your cooleagues.
* Note down which parts gave you problems/where unclear to you. Your colleagues may be able to help you and are interested in discussing them with you.
